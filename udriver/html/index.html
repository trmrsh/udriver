<h1>The ULTRACAM Java client/server, version 4</h1>

<p>
ULTRACAM is operated by sending commands to its servers which listen
on several ports. <strong>Udriver</strong> is a program to do this, 
and is designed as a successor to the ATC's Java client. Some of the 
commands send XML files which define multiple properties. These are
known as 'applications'.

<p>
Udriver does the following:
<ul>

<li> Defines the XML application files which are used to drive ULTRACAM. The setup is done from a GUI.

<li> Allows some user-defined information can be added, in particular the target
name and filters.

<li> Reports timing information for the application.

<li> Allows the applications to be loaded from and saved to local disk files.

<li> Acts as a server for 'rtplot' so that the latter can grab the current set
of windows.

<li> Posts XML applications and other commands to the ultracam camera and data servers

<li> Acts as an ETC if given a magnitude and seeing.

</ul>

<h2><a name="installation">Installing the software</a></h2>

<p>
If you already have Usdriver installed, check the version number and then
look at this <a href="CHANGES.html">list of changes</a> to see if you
need to update it.

<p>
If you have not installed it before, as long as you have Java version 1.4 or later available (so that the system
recognises the commands 'java', 'javac' and 'jar'), installation
should be straightforward (on UNIX systems that is). Download the file <a
href="http://deneb.astro.warwick.ac.uk/phsaap/software/Udriver.tar.gz">udriver.tar.gz</a>
(always the most up-to-date version), 'tar xvfz' it. It will create a directory
such as udriver-1.0.0; cd to it, and type 'make'. If that works and the script
it generates works, then define an environment variable TRM_JAVA to point at 
a directory to install, and then type 'make install'.

<p>
At the end of the installation, you will be told how to run the software;
you may want to define an alias. Note that the make also defines an alias
for a directory such as udriver-2.0.2 == udriver so that you can define
an alias that always points to the most recently installed version.

<h2><a name="structure">Basic structure</a></h2>

<p>
Udriver departs from the previous ULTRACAM client in that it works around a
basis set of "template applications" and allows you to change a subset of the
parameters of these. This means that to set up an application you would
perhaps choose "4 windows", and then edit the parameters. When either you post
or save the application, Udriver finds the "4 windows" template, loads it,
edits it to match your choices and then continues. This places an installation 
onus on getting the template files right, and in the right place, but allows one
to switch quickly between different applications with the same sets of windows.
In this sense it is window-centred rather than application centred and is meant
to reflect the way one thinks at a telescope more. 


<h2><a name="configuration">Configuration file</a></h2>

<p>
Once you have installed and used the software, you may want to customise its
behaviour on startup. Many aspects of Udriver can be defined using an ASCII configuration
file. The file is called <a href="udriver.conf">udriver.conf</a> and 
is kept along with the <i>udriver</i> script in the installation 
directory's bin sub-directory. Several aspects set by the config file can be
altered as the program is run in its <strong>Settings</strong> menu,
but you may sometimes prefer to alter the configuration file so that a
particular behaviour is there as soon as you start. For instance, if you are
just interested in trying out window timings, you would want to set the ULTRACAM
servers to be <strong>off</strong>.

<p>
<a href="udriver.conf">udriver.conf</a> is written in ASCII and is
self-explanatory. By default the program looks for the configuration file in the
same directory as the program is stored in. You can override this behaviour by
invoking the script in the following manner
<pre>
udriver full_path_to_an_alternative_config_file
</pre>
(assuming that you have defined the udriver alias as suggested above). Do not use
a relative path to the file because the script runs the program from the
directory containing it, not the working directory.

<h2><a name="settings">Settings menu</a></h2>

<p>
This menu contains a set of switches that can be toggled on and off to vary how
the program varies. Their initial values are set in the configuration file.
'Expert mode' is described in more detail below. 'Templates from server' means
that the template files used to define the different modes are taken from a
standard location on the machine hosting the server (i.e. the rack PC when
observing) rather than from local copies. This should be slightly safer. The
local option was really for development and testing purposes; if the server is
being used many other files are still stored on the server in a standard
location whether or not you check this flag.

<p>
'ULTRACAM servers on' indicates that the data and camera servers exist. It does
not turn them on and off. All commands which deal with the servers will be
disabled if this is toggled off.

<p>
'File logging' means that the more useful of the items that appear in the
lower-left information panel will be saved to disk as an html file. This is
a potentially useful store of information. I recommend that it is always
switched on during observing. When you switch it on, you get the chance to 
choose the file name.

<p>
'Show responses as text' just refers to the way the XML responses from the server
are displayed in the lower-right panel. They can either be shown as text or in
tree form.

<p>
'Confirm target name' is a safety device to increase the chances that you have
entered the right target name, as it is fairly important that you get it right.
The idea is if the settings have changed without the target name changing, then
you will be asked to confirm that the target name is OK.

<h2><a name="expert">Expert mode</a></h2>

<p>
For safety, certain commands enable or disable other commands. Thus,
you will not be able to start an exposure until you have posted it,
or stop one until you have started it. These controls have the
potential to get in the way, and so there is a no-holds-barred
"Expert" mode which will allow you to do anything you like, with
some potential for disaster.

<h2><a name="setup">Setup & Observing panels</a></h2>

<p>
These are two panels on the left-hand side that can be flipped between by
clicking on named tabs.  They group the commands into the ones used to set
ULTRACAM up and the ones that are used during observing when everything is going
OK. The observing panel also displays timing and signal-to-noise estimates
corresponding to the current window values. 

<h3>Observing panel</h3>

<p>
This is the main panel to be used during observing. 
It has the following commands:

<p>
<table>

<tr>
<td><i>Load application</i></td>
<td>This loads window settings from a disk file. This will change the
settings of the top right panel. The values can be immediately be
changed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>Save application</i></td>
<td>This writes the current window settings to disk. If you have used
the settings for a run, saving them will then make it possible to edit
the settings which will otherwise be frozen. This is a safety
precaution to ensure that all settings used are saved.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>Unfreeze application</i></td>
<td>In non-expert mode, the window settings are frozen when they have been used for a run
and can only be unfrozen by saving them to disk, or, as a quick fix, by pressing
this button. The freezing is there for a reason so during observing you should
be saving applications rather than using this button.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>Sync windows</i></td>
<td>When you bin the CCD, then it is possible to have identically
binned windows which are nevertheless out of step with each other. For
instance one window may have xbin=2, with unbinned pixels 4-5, 6-7,
8-9 etc ending up added together, while another may have 3-4, 5-6, 7-8
etc. These two windows are incompatible. To help make sure that you DO use
compatible windows, the 'sync windows' button will be highlighted in
orange whenever you choose incompatible settings with a standard
setting for your chosen binning factors. Pressing it will immediately 
adjust the windows so that this is the case, or you can just adjust
the windows until the button is no longer highlighted. The standard
setting is defined to have pixel boundaries between the unbinned
values of 512 and 513 in both X and Y. There may be a border of unused
pixels depending upon the binning factors.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>Timing details</i></td>
<td>This is an information button that will give many details of
timing and signal-to-noise parameters.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td><i>Post application</i></td>
<td>Before starting a run, the settings must be posted to the servers
using this button. In non-expert mode, the start button will be
disabled until this is pressed.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>Start exposure</i></td>
<td>This starts an exposure and will start exposure and disk space
timers in the panel below. In non-expert mode, this will also enable
the stop button.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>Stop exposure</i></td>
<td>This stops whatever exposure is going.
</td>
</tr>

</table>

<h3>Setup panel</h3>

<p>
This comes in two forms, expert and non-expert. The expert commands
are listed in the order that they should be carried out. They are

<p>
<table>

<tr>
<td><i>Reset SDSU</i></td>
<td>This sends the command 'RCO' to the 
camera server to reset the SDSU controller.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>Reset PCI board</i></td>
<td>This sends the command 'RST' to the 
camera server to reset the PCI board.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>Setup the servers</i></td>
<td>This sends setup applications to the camera and data servers. The
XML responses will be sent to the lower-right information panel.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>Power on</i></td>
<td>This executes the power on application, and then sends the 'GO'
command to run it.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>Power off</i></td>
<td>This executes the power off application, and then sends the 'GO'
command to run it.
</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
In non-expert mode, the commands are <strong>Initialise</strong>,
which combines the first four of the commands above in one sequence,
and <strong>Reset</strong> which combines the two reset commands.

<h2><a name="windows">Window parameters panel</a></h2>

<p>
The panel on the top-right defines all the settings needed to run
ULTRACAM. First come the basic application types, such as "drift mode"
or "4 windows" mode, followed by the readout speed. Then come a series
of numerical parameters with obvious meaning. Below these are five
text inputs which are written to the XML file for the run as crude
headers. The numerical fields have several features which it is worth knowing.

<h2><a name="numerical">Numerical parameter input</a></h2>

<p>
The parameter values defining the windows are entered on the right-hand part of
the GUI; see <a href="screenshot1.jpg">this screenshot</a>. You do
<strong>NOT</strong> have to hit 'enter' to register values. Instead the values
shown in the GUI are always the values that will be used if you save or post an
application.  A process runs which checks the current window parameters every
second or so and estimates timing parameters from them which are displayed in
the right-hand side. This process will also flag any problem values that lead to
invalid window settings.

<p>
The numerical parameters support the following features:
<ul>

<li> Minimum and maximum values. You will not be allowed to set a value
outside this range. Hit the middle mouse button when on a field to see
its allowed range.

<li> Increment and decrement using the up & down arrow keys and the
left and right mouse buttons.

<li> 'Focus-follows-mouse' behaviour, i.e. as soon as you move the mouse
onto a field, you can start to edit it. This means that you do not have to click
the mouse on a field, so that clicking always implies an increment/decrement operation.

<li> Automatic continuous increment / decrement by holding down the
respective arrow keys or mouse buttons. 

<li> Acceleration of the automatic changes by a factor of 10 by holding down the SHIFT key at
the same time, and by a factor of 50 by holding down both the SHIFT and
CTRL keys.

<li> Jumping through pre-defined values by holding down the CTRL key.  This is
only implemented for the NY parameter of the first window pair where it allows
you to jump between the 'magic values' which give minimal pipe shifts in drift
mode (see the <a
href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/physics/people/vdhillon/ultracam/appdoc/Application_Documentation_R1.0.html">CCD
application document</a> for full details of this). Note that the NX and NY
fields are affected by the binning factors and will be restricted to multiples
of the current binning factors. This also applies to the 'magic values', which
will be skipped if they are not commensurate with the NY binning factor.
</ul>


<h2><a name="observing">Observing / non-observing mode</a></h2>

<p>
The configuration file allows you to run in a reduced 'non-observing'
mode (see <a href="screenshot2.jpg">this screenshot</a>). This is
designed to help with working out counts for a particular setup while
avoiding showing inaccessible and irrelevant commands.  Given a target magnitude,
seeing, sky background (in magnitudes in 1 arcsec**2) and airmass, it
calculates the total counts from the object (assuming an infinite
aperture) which is useful for checking throughput, the peak counts in
a <strong>binned pixel</strong> useful for estimating the possibility
of saturation and then the signal-to-noise, assuming you expose for 3
hours in the defined setup, and that you use apertures with radii 1.5
times the seeing (assumed gaussian profiles to compute the loss of
flux). Typical extinction coefficients are applied for the chosen
band, readout and sky noise are added. The value given is an upper
limit to the noise as it does not account for pixellation noise or any
uncertainty in estimating the sky value. It is designed to allow you
to see what effect setup changes are making to the overall
signal-to-noise that you would get after a certain length of
time. This is more useful than the signal-to-noise in one exposure
which depends mostly upon the particular exposure time you have.

<p>
The horizontal separator separates essential information and actions
for observing (above the line) from useful extra and information
(below the line).

<p>
<h3><a name="timing">Timing information</a></h3>

<p>
The observing panel displays timing information computed from the windows in the
right-hand panel. During exposure it also maintains a timer and an indication of
the amount of disk space used. The latter is only as good as the timing
estimates and should not be relied on 100%. More details of the timing
information, can be obtained by pressing the 'Timing details' button. 

<h2><a name="signal">Signal-to-noise information</a></h2>

<p>
The signal-to-noise estimates include read noise which varies with
binning factor. We only have measurements for 1x1, 2x2, 4x4 and 8x8
and therefore some approximations need to be made for other binning
factors. At the moment the code takes the maximum of the x and y
binning factors = 'bin', and uses the translation table

<p>
<table>
<tr><th>bin</th><th>Read noise measured from:</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td>  <td>1x1</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td>  <td>2x2</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td>  <td>2x2</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td>  <td>4x4</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td>  <td>4x4</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td>  <td>4x4</td></tr>
<tr><td>>6</td> <td>8x8</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The code reports the total counts assuming one could use a photometric
aperture of infinite size. This is useful for throughput estimates
independent of seeing. It also works out how many counts to expect in
an aperture of radius 1.5 times the seeing (typically fairly close to the
optimum value in practice) and computes
signal-to-noise estimates on this basis. These include the readout
noise, accounting for the number of pixels covered by the aperture,
sky background and dark count as well as the object counts. The value
that would be obtained during a 3 hour run is provided so that
different setups can be compared directly in terms of the
bottom-line. Remember of course that if this is a very large value,
systematics may get in the way in practice, although in some cases
(e.g. periodic signal detection) it may be useful up to quite large
values. The 'Timing details' button gives many more details of the
signal-to-noise estimate and is useful to see what exactly is dominating 
the noise.

<h2><a name="trouble">Troubleshooting</a></h2>

<p>
The GUI attempts to work out which commands are possible, e.g. to prevent you
sending 'start run' twice in a row to the servers. It is possible that it will 
get confused, with the result that it might prevent you from
doing something that you know to be possible. To get round this, switch to
'Expert mode' (can be set in the configuration file or from the 'Settings' menu)
which will remove all safety checks. Once you have managed to execute the command
you want, it should be possible to switch back into the checked,
non-expert mode and carry on.

<p>
A related feature is that you may find that sometimes all of the
windows settings buttons are disabled. This occurs when you have used a given
setup to make a run but have not saved it to disk. Because it could be
useful to be able to recover the setup for a run, this is a safety
measure to ensure that you do save all setups. Again, this check is
removed in expert mode and you can hit 'Unfreeze udriver' to get round
it if you really don't want to save anything. As it is potentially annoying
however, this behaviour is configurable both in the configuration file
or through the settings menu.

<p>
It is important to understand that the client <strong>is not</strong> ULTRACAM.
It merely sends information to and receives data back from the ULTRACAM servers
using http requests.  Thus you can CTRL-C or hit the exit button and ULTRACAM
will carry on unchanged.  e.g. it will carry on exposing. If you did quit the
client for some reason, when re-started the client will start in a default
state that may not represent the state you know ULTRACAM to be in. For instance,
you may know that ULTRACAM is set up and want to post an application, but the
client won't let you. It is therefore very likely that you should switch to
'Expert mode' in such circumstances. This will allow you send any command,
including ones that should <strong>not</strong> be sent, so take care. As said
above, as soon as you have successfully executed a command in expert mode,
everything should be back to normal, and you can switch back to checked mode
once more. This also means that should you be controlling ULTRACAM from a
machine that goes down, but you think that the rack PC and ULTRACAM are still
running, as long as you have another machine that can reach the rack PC over the
network, you should be able to control ULTRACAM using it. Again you almost
certainly need to start in 'expert mode', e.g. so that you can stop an
exposure. You could also have two such clients running at the same time (but not
on the same machine unless you change the port used for the rtplot server).

<p>
Therefore when observing, it is a good idea to install the client on all
laptops (running in expert mode by default) as well as the ULTRACAM data PC 
in case the latter falls over, as it has done in the past. Similarly, it would 
a seaman-like precaution always to have a laptop connected to the rack PC while 
observing.

<p>
Finally the nature of the client means that it is possible to alter
parameters while an exposure is running with no ill effect. ULTRACAM will only
have its windows set up when you have posted the application. In the non-expert
mode, you will not be allowed to post an application while an exposure is taking
place.
